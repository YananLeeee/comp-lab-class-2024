To prepare for the MD simulation, ensure the following steps are followed:
Topology: prepare GROMACS-formatted structure file
Box: define the box
Solvent: fill it with solvent
Ion: add ions
EM: the structure is relaxed
nvt: stabilized the temperature of the system.
npt: equilibration of pressure
MD: run MD
