# Analysis Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for analyzing the trajectory data:
Potential energy.ipynb: analyzing the potential energy. Now that our system is at an energy minimum, we can begin real dynamics.
Temperature.ipynb: analyzing the temoerature. The temperature of the system quickly reaches the target value (300 K), and remains stable over the remainder of the equilibration.
Pressure.ipynb: analyzing the pressure. The pressure value fluctuates widely over the course of the 100-ps equilibration phase, but this behavior is not unexpected.
Density.ipynb: analyzing the density.The density values are very stable over time, indicating that the system is well-equilibrated now with respect to pressure and density.
RMSD.ipynb: analyzing the RMSD relative to the crystal structure. Both time series show the RMSD levels off to ~0.15 nm (1.5 Ã…), indicating that the structure is very stable.
gyrate.ipynb: analyzing the radius of gyration of a protein.
